Objective
---------
Get started with Git for version control of your projects


Background/Recap
----------------
Ever been in a situation where

You badly needed your old code but it's lost beyond the reach of Ctrl-Z

You take backups of your work in progress into different folders like project-x-01082020, project-x-02082020 etc.

You need to integrate changes made to a project independently by your team members without losing any code

You need to keep track of metadata on a project worked on by multiple developers like - what/who/when/why for any changes made

*) 
Version control systems help in these situations. They help us keep track of changes to our files by taking snapshots of them. We can look at earlier snapshots and also restore our code to an earlier snapshot. This lets us work on our projects without worrying about introducing errors to partly/completely working versions and not being able to go back.

Git is one of them, probably the most popular one.

*)
Git projects are called Repositories and contain Git related files apart from the project files we add. These git files contain info about all the changes made - who made the changes, what changes were made, when was it made etc. Similar to having Google Drive for file sharing, we have version control providers like GitLab, GitHub etc. to facilitate the use of Git repositories.

Primary goals
-------------
Understand how Git works

Learn the basic Git commands

Setup -1:
---------
Setup - Crio Workspace
Follow the textual instructions if you have access to the Crio workspace
These are the links to the GitLab repository created for you. We’ll use these in the next milestone

*) git@gitlab.crio.do:COHORT_ME_GIT_BASICS_ENROLL_1596802014715/ram75353-ME_GIT_BASICS.git

*) https://gitlab.crio.do/COHORT_ME_GIT_BASICS_ENROLL_1596802014715/ram75353-ME_GIT_BASICS.git

Goto the above https link to view your Git repository in https://gitlab.crio.do. You’ll need to sign in with Google using the account registered with Crio.
Note
Setup is complete and you can move on to "Milestone 1 - Get that Code".


Setup - Gitpod Workspace
------------------------
Note: If you are having access to the Crio workspace, you don’t have to use Gitpod. You can move ahead to the next milestone to get started.


Follow the below video or the set of textual instructions given below if you are working in the Gitpod workspace

Youtube URL: https://youtu.be/W78b-0x6jnE

Goto the Gitpod workspace and open the terminal from within

*)To download/upload contents from/to the above Gitlab repositories you’ll have to prove you’re having access to it. Execute the below command to generate an SSH key. SSH protocol allows you to remotely access machines using the SSH key.

**)ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "crio-git-byte"

Did you notice you were given two links to your Gitlab repository earlier? The one which starts with git@gitlab.crio.do is to be used to authenticate using SSH. The https link authenticates using your gitlab.crio.do username and password

*) Execute cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub and copy the public key printed. You’ll add this to https://gitlab.crio.do/ in the next step


Goto https://gitlab.crio.do/ and copy-paste this key by following the instructions in the below video. (Note: You have to visit https://gitlab.crio.do/ and not gitlab.com)
